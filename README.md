## Project goal

The aim of this project is make dataset analysis, establishing a research hypothesis and develop a regression model showing the trend. 

## Dataset

The analyzed data set was created by combining:
* [London Weather Dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data) - containing daily measurements of weather conditions from a weather station near Heathrow Airport in London
* [London Reservoir Levels]( https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-reservoir-levels) - showing daily Reservoir levels in London as percentage of usable or deployable capacity in the Lower Lee Group and Lower Thames Group reservoirs.

## Research hypothesis
    How impact weather conditions in London on the percentage of usable water capacity in the 'Lower Thames Group' reservoirs?

## Comparison of regression models
